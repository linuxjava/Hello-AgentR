# Database Query Performance

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

Slow query work starts with the query shape and evidence, not with random index creation.

## Rules

- Capture the exact query, parameters, and access path.
- Run explain or equivalent plan inspection before adding indexes.
- Match indexes to filter, join, sort, and coverage needs.
- Fix N+1 at the query pattern or loading strategy, not by caching first.

## Verify

- [ ] Explain plan was reviewed.
- [ ] Proposed index maps to a named query path.
- [ ] Write cost of the index is acceptable.
- [ ] Pagination or batch loading avoids deep scans or N+1 loops.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No blind indexes**: every index needs a query owner.
- **No cache-first latency fix**: fix query shape before hiding it.
- **No ORM opacity**: inspect generated SQL when the ORM is involved.
