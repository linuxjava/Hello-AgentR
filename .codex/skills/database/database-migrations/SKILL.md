# Database Migrations

## **Priority: P0 (CRITICAL)**

Use expand -> backfill -> contract for risky changes.

## Rules

- Ship additive schema first.
- Backfill with resumable logic and visibility.
- Flip reads/writes only after new shape is populated.
- Drop old columns or indexes in a later safe step.

## Verify

- [ ] Migration can run without taking the app offline.
- [ ] Backfill ownership, batching, and monitoring are defined.
- [ ] Rollback or pause strategy exists.
- [ ] Old and new code paths can coexist during rollout.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No destructive one-shot rename**: expand and migrate first.
- **No hidden backfill**: long data moves need explicit plan and observability.
- **No app deploy coupling by accident**: schema and code rollout order must be clear.
